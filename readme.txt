Task 1.2
- Importing and Creating Driving Cycles: Optimize in terms of code density
- Simulating One Cycle: Optimize in terms of code density
- Create and Simulate Three Different Cycles: Urban, Rural, Terrain.

Task 2.1
- Range Simulation of the GM EV1 Electric Car: Optimize in terms of code density
- Fuel Cell Range Simulation: Optimize in terms of code density
- Study and Simulate Range for your own selected EV for both Electric Battery and Fuel Cell (above).

Task 2.2
- Motor Efficiency Plots: Optimize in terms of code density
- Produce Efficiency Contours for Three Other Motor Types with Different Variable and Fixed Losses.
